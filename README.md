This is my personal blog where I write stuff related to **javascript** and **THREE.js**.

My interest is to program computer graphics examples, fractal trees and code-written animation.

This blog was initially built using Jekyll and github pages. On July 2016 I removed Jekyll completely and used my own gulp boilerplate. So it's just plain HTML, CSS and JS for now.
