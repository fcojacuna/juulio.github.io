<p>This is an example of a beautifully crafted Fractal Binary Tree using HTML5 Canvas + javascript</p>
<p>This code example was taken from the <b>Supercharged JavaScript Graphics</b> book by Raffaelle Cecco.</p>
<p>I just modified a few parameters. Each time you reload the page, the tree will re-generate itself in a different way.</p>

<canvas id="canvas" width = "640" height = "480" style="border:1px solid"> No HTML5 Canvas detected!
</canvas>
<script src="/js/canvasExperiments/jsFractalBinaryTree01.js"></script>
