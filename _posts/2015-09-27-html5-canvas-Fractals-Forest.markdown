<p>After looking for some javascript Fractal Binary Tree examples I mixed them together to create what I call a Fractals Forest.</p>
<p>The idea is to use random values to create several Fractal Binary Trees and draw them using javascript on HTML5 Canvas.</p>
<!-- <p>Click <span class="fractalTreeButton">this button</span> to re-generate the forest.</p> -->

<canvas id="canvas" width = "740" height = "700" style="border:1px solid"> No HTML5 Canvas detected!
</canvas>
<script src="/js/canvasExperiments/fractalForest.js"></script>
