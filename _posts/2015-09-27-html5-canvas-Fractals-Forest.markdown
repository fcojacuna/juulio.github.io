<p>Tthis is an example of a beautiful Fractal Binary Tree drawn using HTML5 Canvas + javascript</p>
<p>This code example was taken from the <b>Supercharged JavaScript Graphics</b> book by Raffaelle Cecco.</p>
<p>I just modified a few parameters to make the branches look thicker.</p<
<p>Click <span class="fractalTreeButton">this button</span> to re-generate the tree.</p>
