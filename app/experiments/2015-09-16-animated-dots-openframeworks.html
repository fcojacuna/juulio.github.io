Objective: using a transparent png image as a mask, move some dots inside of it. I’m using a wild cat image and I’m planning to move the dots on its skin inside of it.

How to show a transparent png image on openframeworks?
Use  ofEnableAlphaBlending();
First you must enable it and then use a color so it’ll render transparently. In the basic case (has worked for me), just add setColor(255);

Steps taken:
1- Created a new openframeworks project using the “project Generator” exe file, located on the projectGenerator folder. It’s called “movingDots”.

2- Open the movingDots project on the apps\myApps\movingDots folder. Click the movingDots workspace file or hit Ctrl + O

3- On the testApp.cpp file, declare 3 ofImage elements:

ofImage catBackground;
ofImage catMask;
ofImage dots;

Project's actual status: an empty cat with no moving dots.
<img src="{{ "/images/2015set/catStatus.png" | prepend: site.url }}" alt="openframeworks animated dots" />

Something that happened on the way: super cool cat dots!
<img src="{{ "/images/2015set/catOnlyDots.png" | prepend: site.url }}" alt="openframeworks animated dots" />

Platform: Windows 8, openframeworks 0.7.4
IDE: CodeBlocks
