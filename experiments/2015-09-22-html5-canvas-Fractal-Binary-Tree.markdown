<p>This is an example of a beautiful Fractal Binary Tree drawn using HTML5 Canvas + javascript. This code example was taken from the <b>Supercharged JavaScript Graphics</b> book by Raffaelle Cecco. I just modified a few parameters to make the branches look thicker.</p>
<p><span class="fractalTreeButton">Click Here</span> to re-generate the tree.</p>

<canvas id="canvas" width = "640" height = "480" style="border:1px solid"> No HTML5 Canvas detected!
</canvas>
<script src="/js/canvasExperiments/jsFractalBinaryTree01.js"></script>
